#### Quick Create Link
use < > around the url or email to just make it a link. But you might need to use the https:// at the start to get it to recognize it properly in Obsidian.
<https://www.google.com>


****

#### Inline  Links:
 First brackets then parenthesis
 No space between the two items
[link title](www.url.com)


Reference Links:
Reference links don't appear in the rendered Markdown. 
They are defined by tag brackets with tag -> : then url

In the main text block - use a a pair of [ ] [ ] 
First [ ] is for display text
Second [ ] is for the tag

Link the definition to the url 
(Place at end of document for easy link modification)
*note that there is bracket : then space url*
[tag ]: url

###### Example:
All buildings are [taller then everything else][link1]
this is the rest of my paragraph. and the text keeps going on and on and on. Until I need to prove that [new york city][link2] has the most tall buildings and its the tallest...but also i can keep the link names in line like this. Be sure to check out [google][google.com] for reference! Oh, and I can reuse the links like this. The building link again is [here it is again][link1]. Just in case you needed to get to the tall building source.

Links: The value of this is that I can just change the link here 
[link1]: www.tallbuildings.com
[link2]: www.nyc.gov
[google.com]: www.google.com
